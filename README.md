# Lenovo Thinkpad T450 & T450s Hackintosh Guide for Catalina, Big Sur with OpenCore
This repo contains the installation guide and EFI files required to get a perfectly functional  Catalina, Big Sur, Monterey hackintosh on your T450 or T450s since they share the same hardware. Everything is stable and functional as described in this Readme. 

## A few worthy mentions about this repo:

- **This guide is not for models with Haswell 4th gen CPU**
- **The patched ACPI files were first created by [EchoEspirit](https://github.com/EchoEsprit/Hackintosh-Catalina-OpenCore-Lenovo-T450s-efi). Then [racka98](https://github.com/racka98/Lenovo-Thinkpad-T450-T450s-Hackintosh-Guide-Opencore) Tweaked couple of things and fixed some errors and Released for some months to opencore 0.7.0. Later I tweaked couple of things and Updated the Release of 0.7.0 to 0.8.2.**
- **I will try my best to keep the repo updated with the latest kexts and OpenCore version**
- **This EFI works with ,MacOS Big Sur, Catalina (Need to tweak some of the things to work perfectly.**
-**For macOS Monterey this EFI will work great as BigSur, But audio is not working Only in Monterey. Tried many ways to fix but may fix later releases. so don't expect flawless functionality**
- **This EFI is Configured with Big Sur in mind. If you are using it on Monterey, Catalina read the the whole guide to know where to make the necessary changes**
- **With every EFI update you retrieve from here please remember to go through the post install guide**

# Installation Guide (Online Installer Reccomended)
## Gibmacos installation process may not work for this EFI(I didn't test this process for this release of efi)but you can try.
## macOS Bigsur Online Installer with Windows:
**This is a simple and quick summary of the online install USB creation**

Windows Guide:(Works for Macos users also)

1. Download [rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/)
2. Select the desired flash drive or Sdcard you would like to put the installer on under the device option
3. Select `non-bootable` as the boot selection (REQUIRED)
4. Select `FAT-32` or `Large FAT-32` as the partition scheme
5. Open up the usb partition in file explorer and delete the files created by rufus
6. Create a folder on that partiton named `com.apple.recovery.boot`
7. Install Python from Microsoft store or Download manually here -> [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (Make sure you select add python x.x to path)
8. Download and extract the [OpenCore Package](https://github.com/acidanthera/OpenCorePkg/releases)
9. Select the macrecovery folder in the opencorepkg folder at `/Utilities/macrecovery/`
10. Click on home > copy path at the top of file explorer
11. Fire up command prompt and type `cd` and hit spacebar and paste the path of the macrecovery folder.
12. Run the command `macrecovery.py -b Mac-42FD25EABCABB274 -m 00000000000000000 download`
13. This will put some files in the macrecovery folder but we only need BaseSystem.dmg and BaseSystem.chunklist (takes approx. 600mb to 800mb internet)for Downloading the Macos installer.
14. Paste both of those files in the `com.apple.recovery.boot` folder in your flash drive partiton
15. Download the latest EFI created [here](https://github.com/devboloji/Lenovo-Thinkpad-T450-T450s-Hackintosh-Guide-Opencore/releases)

17. Restart your laptop and hit `F12`
18. Select your flash drive as temporary boot option
