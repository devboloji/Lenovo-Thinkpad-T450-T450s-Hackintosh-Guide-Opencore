# Lenovo Thinkpad T450 & T450s Hackintosh Guide for Mojave, Catalina, Big Sur & Monterey with OpenCore
This repo contains the installation guide and EFI files required to get a perfectly functional Monterey, Big Sur, Catalina and Mojave hackintosh on your T450 or T450s since they share the same hardware. Everything is stable and functional as described in this Readme. 

## A few worthy mentions about this repo:

- **This guide is not for models with Haswell 4th gen CPU**
- **The patched ACPI files were first created by [EchoEspirit](https://github.com/EchoEsprit/Hackintosh-Catalina-OpenCore-Lenovo-T450s-efi). I tweaked a couple of things and fixed some errors that were happening on T450 + added Intel WiFi drivers from [Openintelwireless](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless)**
- **I will try my best to keep the repo updated with the latest kexts and OpenCore version**
- **This EFI works with macOS Monterey, Big Sur, Catalina and Mojave**
-**For macOS Monterey this EFI will not have full support since it's still in Beta so don't expect flawless functionality**
- **This EFI is Configured with Big Sur in mind. If you are using it on Monterey, Catalina or Mojave read the the whole guide to know where to make the necessary changes**
- **With every EFI update you retrieve from here please remember to go through the post install guide**
